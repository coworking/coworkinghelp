## About This Site

This page was born out of many conversations at coworking conferences where fellow coworking
enthusiasts have talked about creating a simple list of consultants to make it easier
for everyone to find help.  

[Jacob](https://kanawha.design/jacobsayles) created this using GitHub and Airtable.
To collaborate with other consultants, [Iris](https://www.facebook.com/slickiris) created a
[Consultants Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1204781973014967/).
We also have
[#consultants](https://coworkingleadership.slack.com/messages/CH7RF8B5J) on the
[Coworking Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/coworkingleadership/shared_invite/enQtNDM0MTM4OTYxOTQwLTliMTYwNzdjYTgzOGU3ZDJjYmRmZGYyY2RlMzI1ZjQxZWU2ZTE3MWM1MmFmZGY5MDM2MzQwMTZmZDc2NzExMjg).
For ongoing discussions, the best place is [The Coworking Forum](https://forum.coworking.org/).

## About This Site

This page was born out of many conversations at coworking conferences where fellow coworking
enthusiasts have talked about creating a simple list of consultants to make it easier
for everyone to find help.  

We've also created a [Consultants Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1204781973014967/) and
[#consultants](https://coworkingleadership.slack.com/messages/CH7RF8B5J) on the
[Coworking Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/coworkingleadership/shared_invite/enQtNDM0MTM4OTYxOTQwLTliMTYwNzdjYTgzOGU3ZDJjYmRmZGYyY2RlMzI1ZjQxZWU2ZTE3MWM1MmFmZGY5MDM2MzQwMTZmZDc2NzExMjg).
For ongoing discussions, the best place is [The Coworking Forum](https://forum.coworking.org/).

The site is hosted on GitHub and all the data is stored in a simple airtable.
The functionality of this site will grow over time.  It's still early days.
